#' Computes minimum and maximum money pump index
#'
#' The nonparametric GARP test is "sharp" in nature. This means that the test will only tell us whether the observed data
#' set is consistent with GARP. However, when the data set fails, it is often useful to know how close the observed behavior is to
#' satisfying the rationality restrictions (see Varian (1990) for an extensive motivation). Over the years, several measures (called
#' goodness-of-fit indices) have been introduced to evaluate the degree to which the observed data set is consistent with the
#' rationality axiom. Echenique et al. (2011) proposed the money pump index (MPI) as a measure of the severity of a GARP violation.
#' The MPI is defined as the amount of money that an arbitrageur can pump from the consumer. The higher is
#' the MPI value, the more severe is the violation of rationality. While the MPI measure is conceptually appealing, it may
#' be computationally challenging to determine this index for data sets with a large number of observations. In particular,
#' Smeulders et al. (2013) showed that computing the mean and median MPI is an NP-hard problem. As easy-to-apply
#' alternatives, they proposed the minimum and maximum MPI which can be computed efficiently (in polynomial time).
#' This function implements the algorithm provided by these authors to measure the minimum and maximum MPI values for the
#' given data set.
#'
#' @param p A \eqn{T X N} matrix of observed prices where each row corresponds to an observation and each column
#' corresponds to a consumption category. \eqn{T} is the number of observations and \eqn{N} is the number of consumption
#' categories.
#'
#' @param q A \eqn{T X N} matrix of observed quantities where each row corresponds to an observation and each column
#' corresponds to a consumption category.\eqn{T} is the number of observations and \eqn{N} is the number of consumption
#' categories.
#'
#' @return The function returns two elements. The first element (\code{minimum_MPI}) is the minimum MPI and the second
#' element (\code{maximum_MPI}) is the maximum MPI.
