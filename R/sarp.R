#' Tests consistency with the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference at efficiency \eqn{e}
#'
#' This function checks consistency of a given data set with the Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference
#' at efficiency level \eqn{e} (\eqn{e}SARP) and computes the number of \eqn{e}SARP violations.
#' We say that a data set satisfies SARP at efficiency level \eqn{e} if \eqn{q_t R_e q_s} implies \eqn{ep_s'q_s < p_s'q_t}
#' (see the definition of \eqn{R_e} below). It is clear that by setting \eqn{e = 1}, we obtain the standard version of SARP.
#' While if \eqn{e < 1}, we allow for some optimization error in the choices to make the data set consistent with SARP.
#' The smaller the \eqn{e} is, the larger will be the optimization error allowed in the test.
#' It is well known that SARP is a necessary and sufficient condition for a data set to be rationalized
#' by a continuous, strictly increasing, and strictly concave preference function (see Matzkin and Richter (1991)).
#'
#' @param p A \eqn{T X N} matrix of observed prices where each row corresponds to an observation
#' and each column corresponds to a consumption category. \eqn{T} is the number of observations
#' and \eqn{N} is the number of consumption categories.
#'
#' @param q A \eqn{T X N} matrix of observed quantities where each row corresponds to an observation
#' and each column corresponds to a consumption category.\eqn{T} is the number of observations
#' and \eqn{N} is the number of consumption categories.
#'
#' @param efficiency The efficiency level \eqn{e}, is a real number between 0 and 1, which allows for a
#' small margin of error when checking for consistency with the axiom. The default value is 1, which corresponds to the
#' test of consistency with the exact SARP.
#'
#' @return The function returns two elements. The first element (\code{passsarp}) is a binary indicator telling us whether
#' the data set is consistent with SARP at a given efficiency level \eqn{e}. It takes a value 1 if the data set
#' is \eqn{e}SARP consistent and a value 0 if the data set is \eqn{e}SARP inconsistent.
#' The second element (\code{nviol}) reports the number of \eqn{e}SARP violations. If the data is \eqn{e}SARP
#' consistent, \code{nviol} is 0. Note that the maximum number of violations in a \eqn{e}SARP inconsistent data is
#' \eqn{T(T-1)}.

#' @section Definitions:
#' For a given efficiency level \eqn{0 \le e \le 1}, we say that:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'
#' \item bundle \eqn{q_t} is directly revealed preferred to bundle \eqn{q_s} at efficiency level \eqn{e} (denoted as
#' \eqn{q_t R^D_e q_s}) if \eqn{ep_t'q_t \ge p_t'q_s}.
#'
#' \item bundle \eqn{q_t} is strictly directly revealed preferred to bundle \eqn{q_s} at efficiency level \eqn{e}
#' (denoted as \eqn{q_t P^D_e q_s}) if \eqn{ep_t'q_t > p_t'q_s}.
#'
#' \item bundle \eqn{q_t} is revealed preferred to bundle \eqn{q_s} at efficiency level \eqn{e} (denoted as
#' \eqn{q_t R_e q_s}) if there exists a (possibly empty) sequence of observations (\eqn{t,u,v,\cdots,w,s}) such that
#' \eqn{q_t R^D_e q_u}, \eqn{q_u R^D_e q_v}, \eqn{\cdots, q_w R^D_e q_s}.
