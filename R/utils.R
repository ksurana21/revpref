# The function "graph_list" creates an appropriate graph list given a data set of prices (p), quantities (q),
# and a value (bound). Both price and quantity matrix are T X N matrices where T is the number of observations
# and N is the number of goods. The parameter "bound" takes a value 1 if upper bound is to be computed and a
# value -1 if lower bound is to be computed.
# For each observation i in {1,2,..,T}, there is a list.
# The list of i-th observation consists of list of 3-element vectors.
# The first element stores all k such that q_i R_0 q_k.
# The second element stores the weight of the edge (p_iq_k-p_iq_i) for lower bound and (p_iq_i - p_iq_k) for upper bound.
# The third element stores the budget of the edge (p_iq_i).
# The function returns a graph list which is a list of T lists.
